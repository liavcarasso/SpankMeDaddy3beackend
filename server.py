    Generate a quirky and useful clicker game upgrade idea for a game named 'Spank Me Daddy 3'.
    The response must be a JSON object with the following keys:
    - "name": (string, quirky name for the upgrade, e.g., "The Infinite Slap")
    - "description": (string, short and humorous description of what the upgrade does, e.g., "A mystical hand that slaps endlessly!")
    - "ppcIncrease": (number, integer, points per click increase, can be 0)
    - "ppsIncrease": (number, integer, points per second increase, can be 0)
    - "cost": (number, integer, appropriate cost relative to a clicker game with current score around {payload.current_score} points. Make it significant but achievable. Example range: 0.05 to 0.2 times current score, or a fixed amount if score is low, e.g. 1000-50000).
    Ensure at least one of ppcIncrease or ppsIncrease is greater than 0.
    The sum of ppcIncrease and ppsIncrease should be between 10 and 1000.
    Example JSON output:
    {{"name": "ביצת הפתעה מוגדלת", "description": "ביצה ענקית שנותנת נקודות בונוס בכל הצלפה!", "ppcIncrease": 50, "ppsIncrease": 0, "cost": 15000}}
